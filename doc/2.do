0.  Walk back through entire tutorial, making new rtp as I go.
1.  Create Version Making step that re-reads document for the test areas, matches existing ones, and adds new ones, puts in links for doc
references, and eventually makes things like indexes for the doc version.  The version of the doc should be inserted to the data with the
version under test.  Each new assignment will give the option for every "DifferentTester" that is non-blank to become owner,
or to be set back to blank.  This allows reasonable owner changes with low levels of energy and confusion.
2.  Signoff records:  Signoff records are only made in the act of signing off.  These will have a creation and modification time, with
ability to modify comments and recent concerns, platform, env, 
3.  User will be signed in, and all tests assigned to him will be available with just a signoff button.  DifferentTester will be
settable by Owner or Admin.
4.	Software, Env, Platform, TestArea record sets will be pretty close to just boilerplate scaffolding.
5.  recommendations will be assignable to areas, and then deleteable when they are no longer used.  Menu will be simple checkbox for each
TestArea.
6.	Versions will only be addable.  Admin gets made permanent at admin signoff.  History Comment will show Who started the version, and any
intermediaries, as well as final.  There will be a version boilerplate list that will allow only read access, and adds.  No deletes, nor edits.
