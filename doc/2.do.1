0.  Get a good working draft from compileCfg.rb.  DONE.
1.  Go back to original rtp, re-install it, and make it basically go.
2.  Translate .rhtml stuff to .haml files (and then go back and finish 1).
3.  Modify rtp to have the following features:
	i.		Historical Owner, defaulting to a configured username.  User's must be identified with email address scannable from Google
Directory, though perhaps this can be done in admscripts as part of deployment.  Historical owner should be a deployable configuration.
	ii.		Part of i will require a source checkin script acting like the opposite of deployments to save the existing deployed areas back
	into archive.
	iii.	Link referencing to document at established location on same machine as part of deployment.
	iv.		Each Signoff involves a Browser/Os combination, AND a test platform, which may be int, beta/gigantic, beta2, or production.  Others may be added to the deployable configurations.  Any given signed off test set can be further signed off on for untested combinations of Os/App and Test platform, which of course involves hundreds of effecive combinations.
	v.		Re-format full page reports, with one for each signoff, and a good sized comment area available.
	vi.		Add password authentication for each person.
4.	Integrate all new items to work in simple scripts like deploy.bash and saveToArchive.bash
5.  Review with Cristina
